Usually there is Vietnamese in Japanese UI. Focus on finding these logic and get them all done. Locale needs very careful focus.

These are all display items in japanese mode but now they are vietnamese.

Also localization is not available when transfering to other tabs. Focus on fixing this as well. For example, I am on this screen: `http://localhost:3000/ja/dashboard/teacher/classes`. When I press the kadai button, it automatically change to vietnamese. Please keep the localization flow right and change the least of code. Make it work flawlessly.

Focus your full efforts on making these run just right.
